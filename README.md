# GBC-1.2
GBC (Game Base Code) Engine

This game engine is largly influenced by The Cherno on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject).
It's more or less a copy paste, although not literally, of their game Engine Hazel.
Obviously, I'm choosing to add, leave out, or tweak certain features to make it how I want.
I'm using a Trello board at https://trello.com/b/DaO3KVu2/gbc-12, however unprofessional it may be.
